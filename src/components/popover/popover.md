## Popover

The Popover is a view that floats above an app’s content. Popovers provide an easy way to present or gather information from the user and are commonly used in the following situations:

- Show more info about the current view
- Select a commonly used tool or configuration
- Present a list of actions to perform inside one of your views

```typescript
const popover = await popoverController.create({
  component: 'popover-example-page',
  ev: event,
  translucent: true
});

await popover.present();
```
